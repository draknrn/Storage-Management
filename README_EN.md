# AWS Labs Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of **hands-on Amazon Web Services (AWS) labs** that I have developed and documented as part of my learning path and training in **Cloud Computing**.

The main goal of this repository is to **demonstrate real practical experience**, best practices, and a solid understanding of AWS services, even without having formal professional experience in the field.

Each lab is **documented step by step**, includes **visual evidence**, real commands, and a dedicated section for **production-level improvements**, simulating scenarios commonly found in professional environments.

## Repository Objectives
- Consolidate hands-on AWS knowledge
- Document labs in a clear and professional manner
- Demonstrate technical skills to recruiters and technical teams
- Practice cloud security, automation, and architecture best practices
- Build a verifiable technical portfolio on GitHub

Each lab includes:

- **Markdown-based documentation**
- Architecture description
- Implementation steps using AWS Console and AWS CLI
- Real validations and tests
- Screenshots as evidence
- Strong focus on security and the principle of least privilege
